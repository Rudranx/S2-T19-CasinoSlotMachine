## Abstract
<details>
  <summary>Detail</summary>
       <p>1. Motivation: The reason we chose the casino slot machine project is because it allows us
       to apply our knowledge of digital electronics to a fun and popular concept. We can turn our
       theoretical knowledge into an interactive game by using flip-flops and logic gates in a real-world
       system like a slot machine. Figuring out how to simulate randomness and design the reward
       system within the limitations of the hardware is a challenging task.</p>
       <p>2. Problem Statement: This project aims to design and build a functional casino slot machine
       using only flip-flops, logic gates, and other essential digital components. The machine should
       replicate the critical aspects of a real slot machine, including random outcomes, user interac
        tion, and reward calculations. We aim to implement the slot machineâ€™s control system and
        output display entirely through hardware without relying on software or microcontrollers.</p>
       <p>3. Features:
       <p>(a) Pseudo Random Number Generator using D-flipflops.</p>
       <p>(b) Player Engagement Mechanism using Counters and Registers.</p>
       <p>(c) Reward Distribution Logic.</p>
       <p>(d) Spin Duration Control using logic gates.</p></p>
